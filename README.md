# Testing

## Functionality testing 

 We used Mozilla web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.
 
 [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) extension to chrome browser was very helpful.


## Compatibility testing
 Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in both Mozilla web developer tolls and Chrome developer tools. 
 
 I tested on hardware devices such as: Lenovo ideapad with Ubuntu and Windows OS's, Lenovo smartphone with Android 7, Google pixel 3 with Android 11.


## Code Validation
 At the and of the project We used two websites to validate a code
 
 * [<span style="color:#ff6100">W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [<span style="color:#ff6100">Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
